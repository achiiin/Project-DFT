After the ananlyse of Coefficient of Variance(CV) for each SMILES group of 
each property, I found that the variation of values in each SMILES group of HOMO is 
small. Thus, I would like to try to use the median value of each SMILES group to 
represent the entire group.

Basically, I will just write a few new lines to import the median values and
the remaining work I will leave for the program I have done before to finish them.
 

The inputs:
DFT_(property)_(index)_(flavorName).csv 
SMILES,amount of this SMILES, max, min, median, mean, MAD, SD, CV


The ouputs:
